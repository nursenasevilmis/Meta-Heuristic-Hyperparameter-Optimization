# ðŸ§  Hyperparameter Optimization for Artificial Neural Networks using GA and CSA

This project was developed to perform **hyperparameter optimization** for **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** using two metaheuristic algorithms: **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA)**.

The **Fruits-360** dataset was used in this study. The following hyperparameters were optimized:

- Learning rate  
- Batch size  
- Number of hidden layers  
- Number of neurons per layer  
- Activation function  
- Optimization algorithm  

Both algorithms were run for different numbers of iterations (e.g., **10** and **20**) and the resulting **accuracy values were compared**. As expected, higher iteration counts generally led to better results.

The outcomes were evaluated to analyze **which metaheuristic algorithm better optimized the ANN's performance**.
